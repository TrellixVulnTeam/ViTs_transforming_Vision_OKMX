# Finetuning and Evaluating Vision Transformers and ResNets for Image Classification
(Validating image classification benchmark results on ViTs, DeiT and ResNets BiT models)

Hello everyone!
This repository contains the code implementation for our project "Transformers Transforming Vision", in which we have revisted the baseline vision transformers such as ViTs, DeiT and compared them with the CNN models like ResNet BiT.
